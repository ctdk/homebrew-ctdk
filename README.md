# Homebrew Grafana

A homebrew tap for installing some programs I've written.

## How do I use this?

`brew tap ctdk/ctdk`

Then, install the program you want with `brew install <formula>`.

You could also install a program with `brew install ctdk/ctdk/<formula>`, or via URL (but doing that way won't get updates) with `brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ctdk/homebrew-ctdk/master/<formula>.rb`.
